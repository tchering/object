In PHP, the : is used in the alternative syntax for control structures. This syntax is particularly useful when mixing HTML and PHP code in the same file, as it can make the code easier to read.

Here's an example of the alternative syntax for an if statement:

<?php if ($condition): ?>
    <!-- HTML code to display if the condition is true -->
<?php else: ?>
    <!-- HTML code to display if the condition is false -->
<?php endif; ?>
